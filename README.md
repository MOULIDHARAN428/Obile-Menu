## WHY OBILE MENU
I built this website as a practise for web development. I started this website in 2020 and am still working on it in my free time. As a beginner,Â 
I didn't use the frameworks like React and Express, and I built it with simple HTML.

## WHAT IT HAS
This site has 6 pages. First one is home which has CEO words, customer reviews and current or upcoming offers. In About section, I have included the Chief words and showcase the
past performance of the hotel with some graphical datas. In contact page, I have provided the form to contact hotel. And remaining 3 pages will have Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner menu.
Each menu will have three sectors like today's special, obile's best dish, today's menu. Along with that we have table reservation button in each page which we be used to book
tables from the web site.

## How I built it
I have built it by using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap** for front-end and **PHP and MySQL** for back-end
