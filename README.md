## WHY OBILE MENU
I built this website as a practise for web development. I started this website in 2020 and am still working on it in my free time. As a beginner,Â 
I didn't use the frameworks like React and Express, and I built it with simple HTML

 WHAT IT HAS
This site has six pages. The first one is home, which has CEO words, customer reviews, and current or upcoming offers. In the About section, I have included the chief words and showcased the past performance of the hotel with some graphical data On the contact page, I have provided the form to contact the hotel. And the remaining 3 pages will have breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus. Each menu will have three sectors, like today's special, Obile's best dish, and today's menu. Along with that, we have a table reservation button on each page which can be used to book tables from the web site

 How I built it
I have built it by using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap** for front-end and **PHP and MySQL** for back-end.
